What is angular Routing?
Angular is an application-design framework and development platform for creating efficient and sophisticated single-page apps.
These Angular docs help you learn and use the Angular framework and development platform, from your first application to optimizing complex single-page applications for enterprises. 

Angular is a development platform, built on TypeScript. As a platform, Angular includes:
A component-based framework for building scalable web applications
A collection of well-integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of features, including routing, forms management, client-server communication, and more
A suite of developer tools to help you develop, build, test, and update your code.

How to use angular Routes?
To understand the capabilities of this , we need to understand the following:
Components
Templates
Directives
Dependency injection

components - components are the main building block for angular application.
Templates - A template is a blueprint for a fragement of a user interface(UI).Templates are written in HTML,and special syntax can be used within a template to build on many of angular's features
Directives- Directives are classes that add additional behavior to elements in your angular application. 
Dependency Injection-Dependencies are typically services,but they also can be values,such as strings or functions. An injection for an application(created automatically during bootstrap)instantiates dependencies when needed, using a configured provider of the service or value.
